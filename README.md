# Description
This is a Python GUI program that opens a text file and displays it's path and contents. \
It can rewrite and save contents of the file with the save button. \
It was created for learning purposes. \
Specifically, to familiarize myself with tkinter and the manipulation of text files using Python.

# Instructions

2. After selecting a file its path and contents will be displayed. 
3. Erase and write input into larger textbox to overwrite the file's old contents upon clicking the save button.
